## System Architecture

### Frontend Component Architecture

The `frontend/src/components` directory contains over 200 React components, organized into the following key areas:

- **Core UI (`/ui`, `/common`, `/base`):** Foundational UI elements like buttons, modals, tables, and layout components.
- **Authentication (`/auth`):** Components for user login, registration, and profile management.
- **Dashboard (`/dashboard`):** The main application dashboard, including widgets and data visualizations.
- **Betting (`/betting`, `/prop-cards`):** Components for placing bets, viewing odds, and managing bet slips.
- **Analytics (`/analytics`, `/charts`):** Advanced analytics, performance metrics, and data visualization components.
- **Real-time (`/realtime`):** Components for handling real-time data updates via WebSockets.
- **Admin (`/admin`):** Administrative tools and dashboards.
- **Settings (`/settings`):** User settings and application configuration.
- **Mobile (`/mobile`):** Components specifically designed for the mobile experience.

This modular structure allows for clear separation of concerns and promotes reusability across the application.

### Frontend Service Architecture

The `frontend/src/services` directory provides a robust, modular, and scalable architecture for managing frontend logic, data fetching, and external integrations. It is organized into the following key areas:

- **API Services (`/api`, `ApiService.ts`):** A centralized service for all backend communication, including authentication, data fetching, and error handling.
- **Real-time Services (`/live`, `RealTimeMoneyMakingService.ts`):** Manages WebSocket connections for real-time data updates, live odds, and betting opportunities.
- **Prediction & ML Services (`/prediction`, `/ml`):** Integrates with the backend's machine learning models to provide predictions, analytics, and SHAP explainability.
- **Data Services (`/data`, `UnifiedDataService.ts`):** A unified layer for data aggregation, caching, and state management, ensuring consistent data across the application.
- **Third-Party Integrations (`/espn`, `/sportradar`, `/prizepicks`):** Services for integrating with external data providers and APIs.
- **Core Services (`/core`, `/utils`):** Foundational services for logging, caching, configuration, and other essential functionalities.

This service-oriented architecture promotes separation of concerns, enhances testability, and allows for seamless integration of new features and data sources.

### Backend Architecture

The `backend` directory contains a sophisticated, enterprise-grade FastAPI application designed for high-performance sports betting analytics. The architecture is organized into the following key areas:

- **API Endpoints (`/main.py`, `/*_routes.py`, `/*_api.py`):** The core of the application, providing RESTful APIs for predictions, data retrieval, and system management. This includes specialized routes for the "Ultra Accuracy" and "Revolutionary" prediction systems.

- **Prediction Engines (`/*_engine.py`):** Multiple machine learning engines, including ensemble, revolutionary, and ultra-accuracy models. These engines are responsible for generating predictions, calculating confidence scores, and providing SHAP explainability.

- **Data Pipeline (`/data_pipeline.py`, `/feature_engineering.py`):** A comprehensive data processing pipeline for ingesting, cleaning, and transforming data from various sources. This includes advanced feature engineering, validation, and monitoring.

- **Services (`/*_service.py`):** Modular services for managing betting opportunities, user data, and other core functionalities. This promotes a clean separation of concerns and enhances testability.

- **Real-time Components (`/ws.py`, `/realtime_engine.py`):** A WebSocket-based system for delivering real-time data, predictions, and alerts to the frontend.

- **Utilities & Core (`/utils`, `/config.py`, `/database.py`):** Foundational components for database connections, application configuration, logging, and other essential utilities.

This well-structured and modular architecture allows for scalability, maintainability, and the seamless integration of new models and features.

### Monitoring & Alerting

The `monitoring/` directory contains a comprehensive, enterprise-grade monitoring and alerting system built on Prometheus and Grafana. This system provides deep visibility into the health, performance, and reliability of the entire A1Betting platform.

- **Prometheus (`prometheus.yml`):** The core of our monitoring system, this configuration scrapes metrics from all critical components, including:
  - **Backend Services:** FastAPI, model services, and data pipelines.
  - **Databases:** PostgreSQL and Redis.
  - **Infrastructure:** Docker containers (via cAdvisor) and host machines (via Node Exporter).
  - **Custom Metrics:** Specialized business and application-level metrics.

- **Alerting (`alert_rules.yml`):** A robust set of alerting rules to proactively notify the team of any issues, including:
  - **Service Health:** Service-down alerts, high error rates, and high latency.
  - **Database Performance:** High connection pool usage and slow queries.
  - **ML Model Performance:** Prediction failures and accuracy degradation.
  - **Data Pipeline Health:** Failures in data ingestion and processing.

- **Grafana (Implied):** While not explicitly configured in the repository, the Prometheus setup is designed to feed into Grafana for rich, interactive, and real-time visualization of all collected metrics.

This setup ensures that the platform is not only performant and scalable but also highly reliable and observable, allowing for rapid incident response and proactive maintenance.

### Testing Strategy

The `tests/` directory contains the testing suite for the A1Betting platform, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the backend services. The current strategy focuses on integration testing of the core API endpoints.

- **Framework**: The tests are built using `pytest` and `fastapi.testclient.TestClient`, allowing for direct and efficient testing of the FastAPI application.
- **Coverage**: The test suite (`test_main_enhanced.py`) provides baseline coverage for key API endpoints, including:
  - System health and monitoring (`/api/v4/monitoring/latency-health`)
  - Core betting features (`/api/v4/betting/value-bets`, `/api/v4/betting/arbitrage`)
  - User management (`/api/v4/user/profile`, `/api/v4/user/profit-analytics`)
- **Methodology**: The tests verify the success status codes and the presence of key fields in the JSON responses, ensuring that the API endpoints are functioning as expected.

This testing foundation can be extended to include more comprehensive unit tests, edge-case analysis, and end-to-end testing to further enhance the quality and reliability of the platform.

### Project Documentation

The `project-docs/` directory contains a suite of automatically generated and manually curated documentation to provide a comprehensive overview of the project's structure, dependencies, and file usage.

- **Cross-Referencing (`PROJECT_CROSS_REFERENCE.md`):** This central document serves as an entry point to the project's documentation, providing links to per-directory file usage analysis and explaining how to use the dependency graphs.
- **Dependency Mapping (`madge-frontend.svg`, `madge-frontend.json`):** The `madge` tool is used to generate a visual dependency graph (`.svg`) and a JSON representation (`.json`) of the frontend codebase. This allows developers to quickly understand the relationships between different modules and components.
- **File Usage Analysis (`*_ANALYSIS.md`):** (Located in individual directories) These files provide a detailed breakdown of the purpose and usage of each file within a specific directory, offering a granular view of the codebase.

This documentation is designed to be kept up-to-date and serves as a valuable resource for developers, AI tools, and anyone else who needs to understand the A1Betting-app codebase.
