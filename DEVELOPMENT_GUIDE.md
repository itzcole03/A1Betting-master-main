## Quick Start (Optimized)

```bash
# Install dependencies with optimized configuration
cd frontend
npm ci --production=false

# Run with performance monitoring
npm run dev

# Build with optimizations
npm run build

# Run comprehensive tests
npm run test:ci
```

## Performance Metrics

### Current Benchmarks
- **Load Time**: < 2 seconds (Target: < 1.5s)
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with code splitting
- **API Response**: < 500ms (Target: < 300ms)
- **Error Rate**: < 1% (Target: < 0.5%)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 80% (Target: > 90%)

### Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time performance metrics
- User engagement analytics
- Error tracking and alerting
- Business metrics (accuracy, profit, etc.)

## Code Quality Improvements

### TypeScript Enhancements

npm run type-check

# Performance analysis
npm run analyze
```

### 2. Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### 3. Production Build
```bash
# Optimized production build
npm run build

# Preview build
npm run preview

# Analyze bundle size
npm run analyze
```

2. Add CDN integration
3. Implement service worker for offline support
4. Add progressive web app features

### Monitoring
1. Integrate with external monitoring services
2. Add alerting for critical metrics
3. Implement user session recording
4. Add conversion funnel analysis

### Testing
1. Add visual regression testing
2. Implement E2E testing with Playwright
3. Add accessibility testing automation
4. Performance regression testing

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- TanStack Query for server state
- Zustand for client state (if needed)
- Context API for theme/user preferences

### Error Handling
- Error boundaries at component level
- Global error handler for unhandled promises
- Automatic error reporting to monitoring service

### Performance
- Code splitting by route and feature
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Bundle analysis and optimization

## API Integration Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- 5-minute stale time for predictions
- 10-minute cache for user stats
- Infinite cache for static data
- Background refetching for critical data

### Error Recovery
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Fallback to cached data when available
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Quality
1. All code must pass TypeScript strict mode
2. 90%+ test coverage required
3. Performance budget: bundle size < 500KB gzipped
4. Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Performance Requirements
1. First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
2. Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s
3. Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
4. First Input Delay < 100ms

### Development Process
1. Feature branches from `develop`
2. PR review required before merge
3. Automated testing must pass
4. Performance checks must pass
