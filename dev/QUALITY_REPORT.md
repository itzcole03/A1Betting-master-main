# UltimateSportsBettingApp â€“ Quality Guardian Agent Report

## Summary (June 12, 2025)

This report documents the initial findings from the Quality Guardian Agent's self-scan and automated QA cycle. It will be updated as new results from lint, test, and build tasks become available.

---

## 1. Lint, Test, and Build Status
- Lint, test, build, and docs tasks were triggered. Results pending; will update upon completion.

## 2. Codebase Quality Findings

### TODOs and Incomplete Code
- Numerous TODOs found, especially in `project_audit_report.json` and code comments. These should be triaged, resolved, or removed.

### TypeScript Issues
- Several uses of `@ts-expect-error` and `@ts-ignore` found. All `@ts-ignore` should be replaced with `@ts-expect-error` and reviewed for necessity.
- Multiple uses of `any` type in legacy test files and some components. These should be replaced with proper types for type safety.

### Python Issues
- `# type: ignore` found mostly in virtual environment packages; these can be ignored for now.

## 3. Recommendations
- Triage and resolve all TODOs and incomplete code.
- Refactor all `any` types in production and test code.
- Replace all `@ts-ignore` with `@ts-expect-error` and document their necessity.
- Continue to monitor for new or unreviewed code.

## 4. Next Steps
- Update this report with lint/test/build results.
- Escalate critical issues to the roadmap and orchestrator.
- Trigger docs and deepsearch agents for major findings.
