/**
 * UnifiedDataEngine (Client-Side Orchestrator)
 *
 * This client-side engine is responsible for orchestrating data retrieval from various;
 * specialized services and potentially transforming or combining this data into formats;
 * suitable for UI components or other core engines.
 *
 * The actual heavy lifting of fetching from diverse external raw sources (Sportradar, Twitter, etc.)
 * and complex aggregation/normalization is assumed to happen on the BACKEND.
 * This engine interacts with backend APIs (via services) that provide already processed or proxied data.
 *
 * Key Client-Side Responsibilities:
 * 1. Provide methods to fetch comprehensive datasets by orchestrating calls to multiple services.
 *    (e.g., getFullPlayerData(playerId) might fetch stats, news, sentiment, projections).
 * 2. Define interfaces for complex data objects that combine information from different sources.
 * 3. Handle client-side caching or leverage caching from services/Zustand if appropriate.
 * 4. Transform data into view models or formats required by specific UI components or engines.
 * 5. Manage data freshness and trigger updates (possibly via WebSocket events or polling strategies coordinated with services).
