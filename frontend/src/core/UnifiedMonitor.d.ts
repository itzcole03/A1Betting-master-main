/**
 * UnifiedMonitor;
 *
 * Provides a unified interface for application monitoring, encompassing error reporting,
 * performance tracing, and custom metric collection. It acts as an abstraction layer;
 * over Sentry and the performanceTrackingService.
 *
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * 1. Centralize error reporting to Sentry, adding relevant context.
 * 2. Simplify starting and stopping performance traces.
 * 3. Offer a straightforward way to add spans to ongoing traces.
 * 4. Facilitate the recording of custom application metrics.
 * 5. Manage user context for error and performance reports.
