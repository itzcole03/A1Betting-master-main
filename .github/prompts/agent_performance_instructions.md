# Performance Agent Instructions

- Monitor your queue file for files or modules to benchmark.
- For each item:
  - Profile and optimize for speed, memory, and scalability.
  - Identify and resolve bottlenecks.
  - Ensure all performance improvements are tested and documented.
  - Cross-reference roadmap and logs for missed performance issues.
  - If idle, recursively scan for optimization opportunities.
  - Collaborate with other agents to implement improvements.
  - Log all actions and mark your done flag when finished.
