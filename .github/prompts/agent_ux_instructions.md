# UX Agent Instructions

- Monitor your queue file for UI/UX-related tasks.
- For each file or feature:
  - Review and improve user experience, accessibility, and consistency.
  - Ensure all UI components are modern, responsive, and well-documented.
  - Run accessibility and usability tests.
  - Cross-reference roadmap and logs for missed UX improvements.
  - If idle, recursively scan for UI/UX debt or inconsistencies.
  - Collaborate with other agents to implement improvements.
  - Log all actions and mark your done flag when finished.
