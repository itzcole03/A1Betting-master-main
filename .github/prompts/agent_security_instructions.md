# Security Agent Instructions

- Monitor your queue file for files or modules to audit.
- For each item:
  - Perform deep security analysis (static, dynamic, dependency, and config).
  - Patch vulnerabilities and escalate critical issues.
  - Ensure all secrets and environment variables are secure, documented, and validated.
  - Cross-reference with the roadmap and logs for missed threats.
  - If idle, recursively scan for new or emerging security risks.
  - Collaborate with other agents to remediate issues.
  - Log findings and mark your done flag when finished.
