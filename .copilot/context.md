# ðŸ“Œ Copilot Context Anchor

- Always use and update `dev/copilot_roadmap.md` as your persistent project roadmap.
- Use it to track:
  - Completed integrations
  - In-progress services/models
  - Legacy code that needs cleanup
  - SHAP overlay status
  - CI and test coverage
- All Copilot completions must align with architecture defined in the roadmap.
