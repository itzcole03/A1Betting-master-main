# Resilience Audit (2025-06-08)

## Frontend Error Boundaries
- [x] Prediction UI: Error boundary wraps PredictionDisplay, fallback shows user-friendly error.
- [ ] Admin Panel: Error boundary not yet implemented (no AdminPanel present in code).
- [x] Global: Error boundary wraps App.tsx, fallback shows global error message.

## Backend Error Handling
- [ ] Auth endpoints: No explicit error handling for missing/invalid tokens. Should return 401 with clear message.
- [x] Prediction engine: try/except and logging added for model/SHAP failures.
- [x] WebSocket: Handles disconnect, logs and notifies clients of disconnect reason.

## Recommendations
- Add React error boundaries to all critical UI modules. (DONE for App and Prediction UI)
- Add try/except and logging to backend endpoints for robust error handling. (DONE for prediction and WebSocket)
- Ensure all user-facing errors are friendly and actionable.
